Hi there\n, We noticed that you haven't logged into Nag recently (which is totally OK, we're not offended.)\n\nBut Facebook has all these rules we have to follow. For us to send Nags on your behalf, once in a while you have to tell Facebook you're OK with us doing this for you (every 60 days).\n\nThe easiest way to take care of this is to simply login to Nag - that's it. Once you've logged in, we'll be able to send Nags for another 60 days.\n\nThanks!\nTeam Nag
