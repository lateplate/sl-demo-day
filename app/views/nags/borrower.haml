      Dan, we heard you're going to 
      %span.item-due 
        Pitchfork Festival. 
    %h2 We're jealous. 
    
    %section.message-to-borrower
      We know it can get pricey with all these summer festivals but it's even pricier when you have to pay for your friend's ticket as well. So why not get that 
      %span.money-owed 
        $40 
      to your friend 
      %span.lender
        Karen 
      so she can spend it on that New Kids concert the night before.

    %section.optional-message
      Enjoy the festival. Stay hydrated. And checkout the "new Belle and Sebastian."
